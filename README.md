# books-app is an app connected with Google Books and Open Library API's. Made following the live on YT https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-qAhg4EDIwQ notJust.dev
You are able to search books from both and add them to Your own screen named 'My books' for example if You wish to save them as a plan to read in the future.
I am planning to develop this app in the future to improve my skills.
